# Tailwind CSS Styling Conflicts with Framework Defaults

This repository demonstrates a common issue when integrating Tailwind CSS with frameworks that have their own default styling.  The problem arises from CSS specificity: framework styles might override Tailwind's utility classes unless properly addressed.

## Problem

Tailwind CSS utility classes might not override existing styles from the base framework if the framework styles have higher specificity.  This leads to unexpected visual results where expected styling changes do not occur.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing CSS specificity.  This can be done by:

* **Using `!important` (use cautiously):**  While this forces the Tailwind styles to take precedence, it's generally discouraged due to potential maintainability issues.
* **Adding more specific Tailwind classes:** This increases the specificity of Tailwind classes and allows them to override the base framework styles.
* **Using CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less:** These can help with better organization and controlling the order of your CSS rules, thus managing specificity better.
* **Overriding framework styles directly:** Directly targeting and overriding the conflicting framework styles in your `styles.css` file or in a separate CSS file can be the cleanest solution in many cases.

This repository shows examples of the problem and how to solve it using different approaches.
